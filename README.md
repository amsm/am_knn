# AM's KNN - Procedural and OOP (Object Oriented Programming) implementations of KNN and related algorithms

## These examples use Ronald Fishser's Iris dataset
### Because KNN is non-parametric (no weights are computed), the features' values are totally important, so...
## this code includes the simplest possible examples of "normalization" and "standardization" of features.
